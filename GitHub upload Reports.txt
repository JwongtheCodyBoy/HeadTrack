First Upload
	- Python Script 
		+ Detects a head with OpenCV
		+ Creates a box around head
		+ Adds a dot to the middle of forehead 
		+ Creates a JSON file and send it to Serial Port COMs Braudrate 9600
		+ Request for Arduino Serial prints
		
		- Have delay to allow Arduino time to process the JSON file 		(I want fix some how)
	
	- Arduino Sketch
		+ Receives Data from Python via Serial Port COMs Braudrate 9600 
		+ Extract JSON with ArduinoJson
		+ Determine angles and distance in units of pixels
			https://everythingfonts.com/font/tools/units/ft-to-px		(1ft = 1152 px)
		+ Calculate the Radian for servo to aim at X and Y 
		+ Changes Radian to Degrees
		
		+ Serial print the Aim (x, y) received and the Degree of x and  y (Degree x, Degree y)

Second upload
	- Python Script 
		+ No change
	
	- Arduino Sketch
		+ Arduino no longer uses Map, went back to using arctan to calculate
		+ New calibrated feet to pixel
			- put ruler on top of head at distance want to aim at, crop image so only ruler exist, width of img
				is 1 feet in pixels
			- find how far I am from camera then convert using unit above

Third upload
	- Python Script 
		+ Added Thread so a second Window appears that shows what camera sees without delay
	
	- Arduino Sketch
		+ No Changes
